## Bachelor's degree program "Computer Science and Technology for Software Production"

### Result of exam for the subject "Testing and software integration"

This repository is dedicated to the comprehensive study and application of software testing methodologies. It covers both black-box and white-box testing approaches. The repository includes:

1. Detailed test cases for various input combinations, boundary cases, and exceptional scenarios.
2. Automation scripts using JUnit to streamline the testing process.
3. Analytical strategies such as MCDC (Modified Condition/Decision Coverage) for code coverage optimization.
4. In-depth exploration and testing of the `indexOfAny` method from Apache Commons Lang's `StringUtils` class, examining inputs, outputs, and specific conditions.
5. Final evaluations and coverage reports highlighting the effectiveness of the implemented tests.
